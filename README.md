## Introduction to programming languages (seminars). Lesson 1

**Task 2:** Write a program that takes two numbers as input and outputs which number is greater and which is less.
a = 5; b=7 -> max=7
a = 2 b = 10 -> max = 10
a = -9 b = -3 -> max = -3

**Task 4:** Write a program that takes three numbers as input and outputs the maximum of these numbers.
2, 3, 7 -> 7
44 5 78 -> 78
22 3 9 -> 22

**Task 6:** Write a program that takes a number as input and outputs whether the number is even (is it divisible by two without a remainder).
4 -> yes
-3 -> no
7 -> no

**Problem 8:** Write a program that takes a number (N) as input and outputs all even numbers from 1 to N.
5 -> 2, 4
8 -> 2, 4, 6, 8
